# 3108ctf

> This was my first time participating in the 3108 CTF, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, especially with its Malaysia Independence Day theme. It provided a great opportunity to develop new skills, boost my confidence, and dive into the rich history of our nation. I was thrilled to secure 184th place out of over 900 participants by the end of the event!
>
> The challenges were well-designed, and I really appreciated how they were presented with a Merdeka spirit. Looking forward to more of these events next year.
>
> Overall, it was a fantastic experience.
